<p>History of Sevantri Temple: </p>

<p>Sri Rupnarayanji Temple is one of the great pilgrimage centers of Sevantri, Rajsamand, Rajasthan, India. Lord Shri Vishnu in this temple is seated with Mata Sri Devi and Mata Bhudevi holding Shankha Chakra (Sridevi Lakshmi ji and Bhudevi are known as Prithvi Mata), these temples are very unique, huge, unimaginable, in fact these temples are not one Rather there are two, that is, without destroying the ancient temple, another new temple has been built over it. This pilgrimage place is surrounded by dense hills of Aravalli range, dense forest, ghats, lake, which are decorated with different types of fruits. (Different types of fruits found in this region probably will not occur throughout India), and this land is ornamented with different types of birds and wild animals, it is a myth that at this place of pilgrimage, a variety of fruits, rare Ayurvedic flora, which are rarely found anywhere other than the Himalaya Mountains. Due Pandavas also chosen as the temporary residence of the shrine and Mantya of the temple was also built and worshiped ever Pandavas. </p>

<p>This temple has been constructed on the top of the hill, below the temple there is a big black and light green looping stone (but now this temple has been transformed into white marble stones). There is a secret cave / tunnel under the Madir (which has been closed many years ago). The idol of Lord Sri Narayana, Lakshmi and Bhudevi is enshrined inside the temple, along with these three idols in the temple, the invisible figure of Ganapatiji, Neeladevi and many other deities - hidden in clothes, and an immortal flame which has been there for centuries. Burning, the statue of Lord Garudji is situated right in front of these idols and behind them is the ancient temple of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh which was in that period and somewhere was not. This temple has been built keeping many Avtar of Lord Vishnu in mind, hence this temple is known as Rupnarayan. </p>

<p>The Madir has three toranas and these three toranas are located in the east, west and north directions. The kund inside the temple is the Pushp Vatika (which is now located outside the temple, earlier there used to be a window in the  gair-nritya Chowk to go there). The toran of that pool is still near the arena outside the temple in the south direction. The water which is brought to bathe Lord Rupanarayanji is a small sacred kudi attached to the Gomti river near the temple and near it is the temple of Lord Shankar at small 3km distance). Lakshman jhula is over the Gomti river, from which it can come from east to west and whoever comes to see Lord Shree Rupnarayan ji and Shree Charbhuja ji, It is of course bathing on the Gomti Ghat. </p>

<p>There was a great devotee named Devaji Panda in the lineage of Nagraj ji and due to his devotion, Lord Shri Rupnarayan ji appeared to him and the stories of his kesh-darshan are still seated in the heart of the devotees of this temple. During the era of Nagraj ji / Devaji Panda, many changes were made in this temple by Balunda Thakar, a new temple was built on top of it without destroying the old temple, which was done in Khajurao style, so in this Mandir/temple both Pandava era and Nagrajji era Visions are there. The sanctum sanctorum and Antarla are still reminiscent of Pandavas, decorated Vimala very well with Antarla, the storehouse is situated in Vimala itself, on the wall above Vimala's gate is decorated with glass of the sun god on the pavilion ( Now they have made new glass of sun god), the statue of Lord Garudji is situated in the pavilion, behind it is the talent of Balunda Thakar, and in it there are Veeraghanta, Nangade etc., Gopalan above the pavilion. There is a very attractive sculpture in the lower part of the temple and from there there is such a beautiful view of the temple built by the Pandavas and the whole state, there is only one stone-made staire-case to go up in the mandap which is probably the one in the whole of India.  Another surprising thing in this temple is that all the pillars of this temple are made only one big stone, while in other temples, columns are made by mixing pieces of stone and no one has counted them till date (many times before An unsuccessful attempt has been made to count coconut, man etc. under every pillar). The construction of Gopuram is very attractive, the Vimana has also been made very beautiful and very long, one can know about the construction of the temple quickly by looking at Pranala, very beautiful to receive the phase nectar from the feet of God. Charanamrit has been made, which will probably be in a few old temples in India, Saptratha is very beautiful, filled with all the directions and fill the mind. Kalasha is also made very big and beautiful, Amalaka is also made beautiful in the temple, on which anyone can stand and shout, very attractive shikhara is built right below the Amalaka, all around the temple. Jagati on the side is very well made with lots of space, thick walls / coats of twenty five feet have been made around the temple, many people including Mughals in Sri Rupnarayan ji temple Invaded those who had come to destroy the temple and plundered, but fearing the many leelas of the Lord, went away after offering some or some gifts. (Among those miracles appeared the kesh-darshan of the  of God, from which blood and milk fell , The big bees sit in a thousand in a single night in the temple, the big bees attack the enemies, the Ganapathi idol is not pulled even by an elephant, etc. After failing-used reasons to give excuse they have  presented gift to God/temple). </p>

<p>Near the Gomti river / ghat inside the boundary of Sri Rupnarayan ji temple there are two sacred and invisible mountain named Hinga-Hingi which is said to have many pilgrimage shrines, etc. in the invisible form, many times when the sage-muni from India year here When they come here to see, they first see the pilgrimage places, temples etc. inside this holy mountain - after about a month, the accounts of Shri Rupnarayan ji While not reaching because here's philosophy is to take a month. (Surprisingly, the temple of Shri Rupnarayan ji is located just 3 km from the Gomti River / Gomti Ghat, Hinga-Hingi mountain, yet it seems a month)</p> 

<p>Nearest temple: </p>

<p>While coming in the path of Shri Rupnarayan ji temple In the middle, at an interval of about 8–10 kilometers, comes the ancient temple of Lord Chattrabhuja Vishnu, which is situated in Garhbor ('Garh' fort and 'Bor' Rajput i.e. fort of Rajputs), there was first called Badri. There was a village which addresses Badri i.e. Vishnu, which was founded in the year 14 AD. </p>

<p>Temple Fairs / Festivals: </p>

<p>A very big fair Bhadrapad Gyaras (Ekadashi) in Sri Rupnarayan ji temple which comes in the month of August / September (there is a fair on the same day in Sri Charbhuja Temple also) at that time thousands / lakhs of people visit the temple. For this, people come from all over India, decorating the Lord in Rewari on this day, in the Pragan / Jagati of the temple, they chant hymns from the Rewari all around and later Rewari Is taken to Amalda Sarovar to sing with thousands of darshanil/devotees. On this day, along with God, Annapurna Mataji's Rewari also takes Amalda Sarovar. Tapes, sticks, talwars, summer, guns, umbrellas etc. and bhajans go on speaking and come back. These bhajans are sung intermittently at certain places. As soon as Amalda reaches the lake, God is immersed / bowed inside the lake, that too hundreds / thousands of pandas, with and in front of the devotees, that scene is very charming, bizarre. In the form of beautiful Rupnarayan ji temple, the second huge fair starts from the second day of Holi Dahan and goes on for fifteen days, in which the Lord gives the light in the afternoon with also rocked bhajans/sing-sing hymns on Dolda Sokla and  played different types of night  gaiir-nritya . In this temple, for centuries, God has been worshiped every dasam night on the day of the day in the temple's pragna / jagti with hymns from Rewari. Annakoot is also celebrated very loudly in the temple.</p>
